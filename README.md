# Natural Language Processing with Transformers ðŸš€  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This repository contains my hands-on practice and learning from the *Natural Language Processing with Transformers* textbook. It follows the bookâ€™s content to implement key NLP tasks while documenting insights for sharing and future reference.  

## ðŸš€ Key Topics Covered  
- Fine-tuning transformer models for NLP tasks  
- Text classification with pre-trained transformers  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) implementation  
- Sequence-to-sequence tasks (translation, summarization)  
- Utilizing Hugging Face Transformers with TensorFlow/PyTorch  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
- Strengthen my practical understanding of **transformer-based NLP models**  
- Apply state-of-the-art techniques to real-world NLP problems  
- Document knowledge to share with others in the NLP community
